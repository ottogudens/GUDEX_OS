# **App Name**: GUDEX-OS

## Core Features:

- Intelligent Appointment Scheduling: Interactive calendar in the web app showing real-time availability of technicians and lifts to avoid overbooking. Integration with Google Calendar for automatic synchronization. Self-management portal for clients to request and view their appointments online.
- Vehicle Reception and Digital Checklist (DVI) with Multimedia: Technicians perform a guided entry inspection from the mobile app. They can take unlimited photos and videos directly from the app to document the vehicle's condition. The client receives a digital copy of this inspection.
- Work Orders (OT) and Visual KANBAN Board: Creation of digital OTs that centralize all information: client/vehicle data, diagnosis, parts, labor, and status. Implementation of a dynamic and visual KANBAN board where OTs move through columns like 'Pending', 'In Diagnosis', 'Waiting for Approval', 'In Repair', 'Completed'. OT status updates in real-time for all users via WebSockets.
- Control of Times and Productivity of Technicians: Technicians can 'clock in' (start/pause/end) each assigned task from their mobile app. The system records these times to calculate efficiency, profitability per job, and manage commissions on labor.
- Real-Time Inventory Management: Digital catalog of parts and products. Stock is automatically deducted when a part is assigned to an OT or sold over the counter. Automatic minimum stock alerts to notify when purchase orders need to be placed with suppliers.
- Budgets, Billing, and Point of Sale (POS): Generation of professional and detailed budgets, sent to the client for digital approval. Conversion of an approved budget to a Work Order (and subsequently to an invoice) with one click. Integrated POS module for counter sales, with cash control and multiple payment methods. Integration with an authorized Electronic Billing provider.
- 360Â° Database of Clients and Vehicles: Unique customer file with contact information, associated vehicles, and complete history of repairs, budgets, and invoices. A secure web portal where customers can log in to view their vehicle history.
- Customer Portal and Proactive Communications: Sending a unique and secure link via WhatsApp, SMS, and Email so that the client can follow the real-time status of their current repair, view photos/videos of the diagnosis, and approve or reject the quote without calling. The system sends automatic reminders for preventive maintenance based on mileage or date of last service.
- Dashboard of Key Metrics (KPIs) and Preparation for Telematics and AI: A visual control panel with graphs showing in real-time: profitability by type of service, productivity by mechanic, best-selling parts, cash flow, etc. The API-first architecture will allow integration of data from third-party telematics systems in the future. All operational data will be stored in a structured way from day one, to train AI models for predictive maintenance.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Red (#FF0000) for alerts and important actions.
- Secondary color: Yellow (#FFFF00) for highlighting and less critical actions.
- Background color: Black (#000000) for a dark and modern aesthetic.
- Body and headline font: 'Arial' (sans-serif) for clear readability. Note: Google Fonts are not supported; using default web-safe fonts.
- Use bold icons related to the repair process and vehicle components, matching the color scheme.
- Ensure a responsive design that adapts to various devices. Use a clear, high-contrast layout to improve readability against the black background.
- Employ simple transitions and animations, such as highlighting Kanban cards or expanding details, for a smoother user experience.
